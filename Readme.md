# Description:
Solving 8-Puzzle with BFS (Breadth First Search) Algorithm 

## Steps Followed 
Find all the possible states of the 8-Puzzle starting from
the given initial state until the goal node is reached. Note
that, the states should be unique (no repetitions).

- From the initial state of the puzzle, use different moves
in all the directions to generate new states, check the
validity of the newly generated node.


- Implement back tracking to find the plan to solve the
problem
